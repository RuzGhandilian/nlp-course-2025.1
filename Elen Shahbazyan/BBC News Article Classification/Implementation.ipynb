       "2223  how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.  \n",

       "      <td>tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems  plasma high-definition tvs  and digital video recorders moving into the living room  the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years  time.  that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend  programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks  through cable  satellite  telecoms companies  and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.  one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes  like the us s tivo and the uk s sky+ system  allow people to record  store  play  pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.  essentially  the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets  which are big business in japan and the us  but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts  they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules  putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as  brand identity  and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment  it is also a concern that is being raised in europe  particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky+.  what happens here today  we will see in nine months to a years  time in the uk   adam hume  the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc  there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters  but brand loyalty is important for everyone.  we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands   said tim hanlon  from brand communications firm starcom mediavest.  the reality is that with broadband connections  anybody can be the producer of content.  he added:  the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.   what this means  said stacey jolna  senior vice president of tv guide tv group  is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks  in us terms  or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future  instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone  the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands  mr hanlon suggested.  on the other end  you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them   said mr hanlon.  ultimately  the consumer will tell the market they want.   of the 50 000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces  many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them  instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax s 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies  directtv  has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability  instant replay  and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo  called tivotogo  which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want  when they want.</td>\n",

       "      <td>ocean s twelve raids box office ocean s twelve  the crime caper sequel starring george clooney  brad pitt and julia roberts  has gone straight to number one in the us box office chart.  it took $40.8m (£21m) in weekend ticket sales  according to studio estimates. the sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across europe. it knocked last week s number one  national treasure  into third place. wesley snipes  blade: trinity was in second  taking $16.1m (£8.4m). rounding out the top five was animated fable the polar express  starring tom hanks  and festive comedy christmas with the kranks.  ocean s twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a december release in the us  after the three films in the lord of the rings trilogy. the sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor  ocean s eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. a remake of the 1960s film  starring frank sinatra and the rat pack  ocean s eleven was directed by oscar-winning director steven soderbergh. soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites clooney  pitt and roberts with matt damon  andy garcia and elliott gould. catherine zeta-jones joins the all-star cast.  it s just a fun  good holiday movie   said dan fellman  president of distribution at warner bros. however  us critics were less complimentary about the $110m (£57.2m) project  with the los angeles times labelling it a  dispiriting vanity project . a milder review in the new york times dubbed the sequel  unabashedly trivial .</td>\n",

       "      <td>cars pull down us retail figures us retail sales fell 0.3% in january  the biggest monthly decline since last august  driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.  the 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected  coming after december s 4% rise in car sales  fuelled by generous pre-christmas special offers. excluding the car sector  us retail sales were up 0.6% in january  twice what some analysts had been expecting. us retail spending is expected to rise in 2005  but not as quickly as in 2004.  steve gallagher  us chief economist at sg corporate &amp; investment banking  said january s figures were  decent numbers .   we are not seeing the numbers that we saw in the second half of 2004  but they are still pretty healthy   he added. sales at appliance and electronic stores were down 0.6% in january  while sales at hardware stores dropped by 0.3% and furniture store sales dipped 0.1%. sales at clothing and clothing accessory stores jumped 1.8%  while sales at general merchandise stores  a category that includes department stores  rose by 0.9%. these strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for christmas.  sales at restaurants  bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%  while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. in december  overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. excluding the car sector  sales rose by just 0.3%. parul jain  deputy chief economist at nomura securities international  said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005  only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004.  consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter   he said. van rourke  a bond strategist at popular securities  agreed that the latest retail sales figures were  slightly stronger than expected .</td>\n",

       "      <td>how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.</td>\n",

       "      <td>souness delight at euro progress boss graeme souness felt newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the uefa cup against heerenveen.  an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them a 2-1 win and a place in the uefa cup last 16.  obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage   he said after the 4-2 aggregate victory.  we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous.  shearer s goal moved him within 12 of jackie milburn s club scoring record of 200 for the magpies. but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season.  i think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway   he added.   he struck the ball very well - he always has done - and i think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper.  souness also paid tribute to laurent robert  who was at the heart of much of united s attacking play.  in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player. more of the same in future please   he said.</td>\n",

       "2223  how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.   \n",

       "      <td>how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.</td>\n",
